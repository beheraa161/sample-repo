What is the difference between scp and rsync ? 

SCP(Secure Copy) >> 
====================
 >> The major difference between these tools is how they copy files.

>>  scp basically reads the source file and writes it to the destination. 
   It performs a plain linear copy, locally, or over a network.
   scp simply overwrites the files in the destination, if they already exist.

example: 
-------

  >> To copy local system files/dirs to remote system .

   # scp --help 

   # scp -av <source_file_path> <username>@<ip/hostnmame>:/<dest_path> 


   >> To copy from remote system to local system 

   # scp -av  <username>@<ip/hostnmame>:/<source_file_path>  <local_dest_file_path>  

rsync(Remote Synchronisation) >>
============================

>>  rsync also copies files locally or over a network.
    Whereas, rsync, skips the files which are already available in the destination.

 >> To copy local system files/dirs to remote system .

   # rsync --help 

   # rsync -av <source_file_path> <username>@<ip/hostnmame>:/<dest_path> 


   >> To copy from remote system to local system 

   # rsync -av  <username>@<ip/hostnmame>:/<source_file_path>  <local_dest_path>
